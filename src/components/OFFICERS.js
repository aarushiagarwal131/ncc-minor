    title: "NATION BUILDING",
    info: "Nation-building always requires partners; There must be communication between people on the ground and people in distant government offices. Nation-building is a process that does not produce clear, quick results. Leadership must start small, addressing basic problems. Public trust  during a period of occupation emerges from the fulfillment of basic needs. Small beginnings must serve larger purposes.Citizens must see the value in what they're doing. Nation-building is about people. Large forces do not move history. It is a pupil who moves history.",
